## Architecture & User Management

### User Model

LogiSys uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system where users are linked directly to entity tables:

#### Entity Tables
- **clientes**: Customer users with `user_id` FK to `auth.users`
- **armazens**: Warehouse users with `user_id` FK to `auth.users`
- **colaboradores**: Employee/Staff users with `user_id` FK to `auth.users`

Each entity table contains:
- Business-specific data (e.g., CNPJ, address for clientes)
- A nullable `user_id` field linking to `auth.users(id)`
- Active/inactive status flag

#### User Roles

Available roles (defined in `user_role` enum):
- **admin**: Full system access
- **logistica**: Logistics team - manages products, stock, liberations, warehouses
- **comercial**: Sales team - can view data and create/manage releases
- **armazem**: Warehouse operators - manage loading operations
- **cliente**: Customers - can create scheduling requests and view their data

Roles are stored in the `user_roles` table with a many-to-one relationship to `auth.users`.

### User Creation Flow

#### Creating a Cliente (Customer):
1. Admin/Logística accesses the Clientes page
2. Fills out customer information (nome, CNPJ/CPF, email, etc.)
3. System calls the `create-customer-user` edge function
4. Edge function:
   - Creates user in `auth.users` with temporary password
   - Assigns the "cliente" role in `user_roles`
   - Creates record in `clientes` table with `user_id` link
   - Returns temporary credentials
5. Temporary password must be changed on first login

#### Creating a Colaborador (Employee):
1. Admin/Logística accesses the Colaboradores page
2. Fills out employee information (nome, CPF, email, cargo, departamento)
3. Selects role (logistica, comercial, or admin)
4. System calls the `create-colaborador-user` edge function
5. Edge function:
   - Creates user in `auth.users` with temporary password
   - Assigns the selected role in `user_roles`
   - Creates record in `colaboradores` table with `user_id` link
   - Returns temporary credentials
6. Temporary password must be changed on first login

#### Creating an Armazém User (Warehouse):
1. Admin/Logística accesses the Armazéns page
2. Can either:
   - Create a new warehouse with user, or
   - Link user to existing warehouse
3. System calls the `create-armazem-user` edge function
4. Edge function:
   - Creates user in `auth.users` with temporary password
   - Assigns the "armazem" role in `user_roles`
   - Creates/updates record in `armazens` table with `user_id` link
   - Returns temporary credentials
5. Temporary password must be changed on first login

### Permissions System

Permissions are managed through the `role_permissions` table, which defines CRUD permissions for each role on different resources:

```sql
role_permissions (
  role: user_role,
  resource: text,
  can_create: boolean,
  can_read: boolean,
  can_update: boolean,
  can_delete: boolean
)
```

The frontend `usePermissions` hook queries this table to dynamically show/hide menu items and control access to features.

### Database Schema Changes (Migration from profiles table)

**Previous Architecture (Deprecated):**
- Used a `profiles` table as an intermediary between `auth.users` and business entities
- All FKs pointed to `profiles(id)`

**Current Architecture:**
- Direct link from entity tables to `auth.users(id)` via `user_id`
- No profiles table - business entities are the single source of truth
- `user_roles` table links roles directly to `auth.users(id)`

**Migration Notes:**
If upgrading from an old version with the `profiles` table:
1. Run migrations in order (found in `supabase/migrations/`)
2. Data should be migrated from `profiles` to appropriate entity tables
3. All FK constraints are updated to point to `auth.users(id)` instead of `profiles(id)`
4. The `profiles` table is dropped in the final migration

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS policies enabled that check:
- User authentication (`auth.uid()`)
- User roles via the `has_role()` function
- User ownership (e.g., customers can only see their own data)

Example policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Clientes podem ver próprio perfil"
  ON public.clientes FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Edge Functions

Located in `supabase/functions/`:
- `create-customer-user`: Creates cliente users
- `create-colaborador-user`: Creates colaborador users  
- `create-armazem-user`: Creates armazem users
- `admin-users`: Generic admin user creation (deprecated, use specific functions above)

All edge functions:
- Use service role for admin operations
- Validate requester permissions
- Generate secure temporary passwords
- Force password change on first login
- Return credentials for the admin to share with the user

## Development

### Environment Variables

This project requires Supabase environment variables to be configured. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-public-anon-key>
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file or share your keys publicly. Use `.env.example` as a template.

#### Supabase Configuration

Make sure the following redirect URLs are configured in your Supabase project settings (Authentication > URL Configuration):

**Production:**
- `https://<your-domain>/change-password`

**Development:**
- `http://localhost:5173/change-password`

These URLs are used for password recovery flows and forced password changes.

### Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
